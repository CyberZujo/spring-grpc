The `Spring gRPC` project aims to streamline the development of gRPC applications.

The xref:concepts.adoc[concepts section] provides a high-level overview of gRPC concepts and their representation in Spring gRPC.

The xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started] section shows you how to create your first gRPC application.
Subsequent sections delve into each component and common use cases with a code-focused approach.
